+update src/structural_engineer_agent/scripts/structural_engineer_agent.py and src/stability_agent/scripts/stability_agent.py: For both the Structural Engineer Agent and Stability Agent, we need to add plan generation capabilities. Please implement the following changes:
+
+1. In the Structural Engineer Agent (src/structural_engineer_agent/scripts/structural_engineer_agent.py):
+
+   a. Add a new method called `generate_disassembly_plan`:
+      - This method should take the validated structure information as input.
+      - It should use the LLM to generate a high-level disassembly plan based on the structure's components and general disassembly instructions.
+      - The plan should be a list of steps, each describing a major disassembly action.
+
+   b. Modify the `handle_validate_request` method:
+      - After validating the request, call the `generate_disassembly_plan` method.
+      - Include the generated plan in the `ValidateRequestResponse`.
+      - Update the `ValidateRequestResponse` message type to include a new field for the disassembly plan.
+
+2. In the Stability Agent (src/stability_agent/scripts/stability_agent.py):
+
+   a. Add a new method called `generate_stability_aware_plan`:
+      - This method should take the task description and stability analysis as input.
+      - It should use the LLM to generate a detailed, stability-aware disassembly plan.
+      - The plan should include specific steps for maintaining stability during disassembly, such as which elements to support and in what order to remove components.
+
+   b. Modify the `handle_stability_analysis` method:
+      - After performing the stability analysis, call the `generate_stability_aware_plan` method.
+      - Include the generated plan in the `StabilityAnalysisResponse`.
+      - Update the `StabilityAnalysisResponse` message type to include a new field for the stability-aware plan.
+
+3. Update the service message definitions in the multi_agent_system package to include the new fields for the disassembly plans.
+
+Please provide the code changes for both agents, including the new methods and modifications to existing methods. Also, include the updated service message definitions.

+run the app again to see an effect of my small changes that I made to: The main issue appears to be in the Manager Agent's process_command method. It's not clearly utilizing the disassembly plan from the Structural Engineer Agent or the stability-aware plan from the Stability Agent. Here's what needs to be adjusted:

+fix `manager_agent`: it seemms that  despite the structural engineer providing thhe correct sequence the sequence was not recognized as stable - it should have been because it was a match in the engineers rag manual. Also the manager should have taken the sequence and pass it directly to planner.

+update `ManagerAgent`: it appears that the manager agent is not handeling the input from `StructuralEngineerAgent` correctly. When it recieves a possitive outcome - the structure matches and says the structure is standard the manager should redirect that directly to planner and not stability. you can see the error in the log: Manager Agent: Planning Agent is connected and ready to work.

+Manager Agent: Received command: disassemble blue frame consisting of 3 elements.. Processing...
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+Structural Engineer Agent: Validation result: Upon analyzing the request "disassemble blue frame consisting of 3 elements," it aligns closely with the information provided in the RAG system regarding the "Simple Portal Frame Disassembly." Here's the detailed analysis:
+
+1. **Match Confirmation**: The request for disassembly of a blue frame consisting of three elements matches with the structure described in the RAG system, specifically the "Simple Portal Frame."
+
+2. **Description of the Matching Structure**: 
+   - The structure is identified as a simple portal frame.
+   - It consists of three elements: two vertical columns (Column 1 and Column 3) and one horizontal beam (Beam 2).
+   - The frame forms a basic 'П' shape and all elements have the same dimensions.
+
+3. **Disassembly Sequence**: The proper disassembly sequence as described in the RAG is as follows:
+   - Support the beam (element 2) to secure the structure.
+   - Disconnect the vertical column (1) from below the beam (2), which is being supported.
+   - The worker should carefully remove the disconnected column 1 using appropriate tools.
+   - Carefully remove the disconnected column (3) using appropriate tools.
+   - Finally, the robot removes the beam (2), that is being supported last.
+
+4. **Safety Notes**: Ensure that all safety protocols are followed, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and certified lifting equipment.
+
+Based on this analysis, I will pass the matching structure details and the disassembly sequence to the manager agent for further processing. The procedure for disassembling this structure is standard.
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+Manager Agent: Your request doesn't follow standard procedures. Proceeding with stability analysis.

+/ask is it possible that `PlanningAgent` and `TestPlanningAgent` always get stup because they are waiting for network connectivity? or might their be any dependencies that need to run for this node to work properly:         # Service to execute plans
+        self.plan_execution_service = rospy.Service('/plan_execution', PlanExecution, self.handle_plan_execution)
+
+        # Publisher to robot control interface

# 2024-09-29 16:50:15.624740
+/ask can we perhaps solve it by creating a .launch file that would launcha all dependant nodes so it is not left hanging. lets say the roscore would be launched in that launch file
